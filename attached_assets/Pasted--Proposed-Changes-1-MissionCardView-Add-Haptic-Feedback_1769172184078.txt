⚠️ Proposed Changes
1. MissionCardView - Add Haptic Feedback (High Priority)
The activate button should trigger haptic feedback on mobile for tactile confirmation.

Issue: No haptic feedback when activating missions
Standard: iOS Human Interface Guidelines recommend haptic feedback for significant actions
2. MissionCardView - Improve Loading State
Issue: No loading indicator when activating a mission
Standard: Users should see immediate feedback that their action is being processed
3. Chat Input - Move to Bottom with Keyboard-Aware Positioning
Issue: Need to verify the chat input properly adjusts when the keyboard appears on mobile
Standard: Input fields should remain visible above the keyboard
4. Confirmation States - Add Success Animation
Issue: "Activated" badge appears instantly without celebration
Standard: Gamified apps (like Duolingo) use confetti/animations for positive reinforcement
5. Touch Targets on Badge/Pill Elements
Issue: The "Suggested Mission" pill badge (line 89-93) is not tappable but looks like it could be
Standard: Non-interactive elements should not look interactive
6. Scroll Area - Add Momentum Scrolling
Issue: Verify -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch is applied for native iOS scroll feel
Standard: iOS users expect momentum/bounce scrolling
7. Button Spacing on Mobile
Issue: In MissionCardView, the flex gap-2 creates buttons that may be too close together on small phones
Standard: Google recommends 8dp minimum spacing between touch targets
8. Accessibility Labels
Issue: Some buttons lack proper aria-label attributes for screen readers
Standard: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requires accessible names for all interactive elements
9. Text Truncation
Issue: Mission titles use no max-width constraint - very long titles could break layout
Standard: Add text truncation with ellipsis for predictable layouts
10. Pull-to-Refresh on Mission Lists
Issue: No pull-to-refresh gesture on dashboard/mission lists
Standard: Both iOS and Android users expect this pattern for refreshing content
